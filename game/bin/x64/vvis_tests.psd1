# VVIS-OPTIX Test Manifest
# Each entry defines a test case for the three-way validation harness.
#
# Three-Way Test Strategy:
#   ref-cpu  = vvis.exe        (SDK reference binary) — ground truth
#   cpu      = vvis_optix.exe   (refactored, CPU path) — must match ref-cpu
#   gpu      = vvis_optix.exe   -cuda (GPU path)       — must match cpu
#
# Keys:
#   MapName             - BSP filename (without extension) in bsp_unit_tests\
#   ModDir              - Relative path to the game mod directory
#   VbspSource          - "local" (.\vbsp.exe) or "sdk" (SDK Base 2013 vbsp.exe)
#   ExtraVbspArgs       - Additional vbsp arguments (array of strings)
#   TimeoutMultiplier   - GPU timeout = max(MinTimeoutSeconds, CpuTime * Multiplier)
#   MinTimeoutSeconds   - Floor for the timeout calculation (seconds)
#   RefCpuTolerance     - Max visual diff % for ref-cpu vs cpu
#   CpuGpuTolerance     - Max visual diff % for cpu vs gpu
#   ArchiveSuffix       - Subfolder suffix in bsp_unit_test_logs\
#   Groups              - Array of group tags for -Group selection
